# Code Review

Please be prepared for a Code Review:
-          15-30 minutes
-          Submit code to hiring team at least 24 hours before the interview
-          Not too short or too long: 100-200 lines of code ideally
-          Code should address an interesting problem (not simplistic)
-          Code should use object-oriented methodology (i.e. multiple classes with inheritance)
-          Code should show some usage of data structures

Also be prepared for a series of code related questions that you will answer live on a virtual white board.
